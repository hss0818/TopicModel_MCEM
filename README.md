# TopicModel_MCEM

Source code for the MCMC-EM algorithm for topic model estimation, which proposed in the paper "Learning Topic Models: Identifiability and Finite-Sample Analysis" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04232).

`MCEM_helper.cpp` contains the helper functions for the implementation of the main function. 
`MCEM.R` contains the main function for the MCMC-EM algorithm proposed in the paper. 
`example.R` contains an example showing how to use the main function to make estimation.
