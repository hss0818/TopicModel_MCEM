# TopicModel_MCEM

Source code for the MCMC-EM algorithm for topic model estimation, which proposed in the paper "Learning Topic Models: Identifiability and Finite-Sample Analysis" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04232).

The “MCEM_helper.cpp” file contains the helper functions written for the implementation of the main function. The “MCEM.R” file contains the main function for the MCMC-EM algorithm proposed in the paper. The “example.R” file contains an example showing how to use the main function to produce the estimation.
